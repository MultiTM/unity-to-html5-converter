# unity-to-html5-converter
Simple Unity to ThreeJS scene converter.

# To Do:

 - Unity: ComponentSerializerResolver:  
 Get rid of mapping dictionary. Use Reflection API and Attributes instead.
 - Unity: Serialization  
 Change serialization from component-based to game object-based (because of ThreeJS object
   system).
 - Unity and ThreeJS: Add more component types support  
 Such as different light types (Directional light, Spotlight, etc).
 - ThreeJS: Setup fileserver  
 Setup HTTP server to serve `.json` files.
